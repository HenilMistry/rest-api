# Rest API
I am learning about REST API. I am interested very much in scripting and all that so i have started learning NODE JS.
It is full of fun and joy.

# API Included
- I have included below api in this project.
  - localhost:9000/aliens

# Functions Included
- I have included below function, urls you can say.
  - GET
  - GET/:id
  - POST
  - PATCH/:id
  - DELETE
  
  # What should be done just befor clone
  - Remember to use command below, just after cloning or forking
    - ```npm install```
 - Reason is that, i haven't included ```node_modules``` in this project. The above command will automatically install all dependencies in your project.
 
 # Expectation
 - I expect that as a respossible developer, you may contribute in discussion of this repository.
